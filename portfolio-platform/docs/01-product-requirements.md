## 7. User Stories

### 7.1 Public Visitor Stories

**US-001**: As a recruiter, I want to see a professional landing page so that I can quickly understand the developer's skills.

**US-002**: As a fellow developer, I want to browse public projects so that I can see practical implementations.

**US-003**: As a visitor, I want to view project details so that I can understand the technical approach and technologies used.

**US-004**: As a visitor, I want to easily contact the developer so that I can reach out for opportunities.

### 7.2 Admin User Stories

**US-005**: As the admin, I want to log in securely so that I can access private tools.

**US-006**: As the admin, I want to access an admin panel so that I can navigate to different private projects.

**US-007**: As the admin, I want to add new projects easily so that I can extend the platform without major refactoring.

**US-008**: As the admin, I want private projects to be completely hidden from public users so that personal tools remain secure.

## 8. Design Principles

### 8.1 Modularity First
- Each project is self-contained
- Minimal coupling between projects
- Shared utilities are truly shared (not project-specific)

### 8.2 Convention Over Configuration
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions
- Use standard folder structures
- Minimize configuration files

### 8.3 Serverless & Edge-First
- Prefer serverless functions over dedicated servers
- Use edge runtime where possible
- Keep cold starts minimal

### 8.4 Type Safety Everywhere
- Strict TypeScript mode
- No `any` types without explicit reason
- End-to-end type safety (frontend â†’ backend â†’ database)

### 8.5 Developer Experience
- Fast local development
- Clear error messages
- Simple setup process
- Automated formatting/linting

---

## 9. Constraints & Assumptions

### 9.1 Constraints
- **Budget**: Free tiers only (Vercel, Supabase, Appwrite)
- **Time**: No hard deadlines, but prefer incremental delivery
- **Team**: Solo developer (all decisions by owner)
- **Scope**: Single admin user (no multi-tenancy in MVP)

### 9.2 Assumptions
- Vercel free tier sufficient for expected traffic
- Supabase free tier (500MB DB) sufficient
- Appwrite free tier sufficient for storage needs
- No need for premium features (monitoring, analytics) in MVP
- Modern browsers only (no legacy support)
- User has technical background (no need for extensive help/onboarding)

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

### 10.1 Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Free tier limitations exceeded | High | Low | Monitor usage, upgrade if needed |
| Platform vendor lock-in | Medium | Medium | Abstract external dependencies, use standard interfaces |
| Complexity creep | Medium | High | Strict MVP scope, defer features to v2+ |
| Authentication vulnerabilities | High | Low | Use established auth provider (Supabase), follow security best practices |

### 10.2 Product Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Overly complex for simple needs | Low | Medium | Keep MVP minimal, iterate based on actual usage |
| Poor project modularity | High | Medium | Design folder structure carefully, enforce boundaries |
| Difficult to add new projects | Medium | Medium | Test with 2-3 dummy projects, refine before real implementation |

## 11. Open Questions

1. **Design System Colors**: Need to finalize color palette - should we use a popular theme (e.g., GitHub Dark, VS Code Dark) or create custom?

2. **Project Names**: How to name dummy projects in MVP for demonstration purposes?

3. **Contact Form**: MVP has direct links only - is a contact form needed later, or external (email, LinkedIn) sufficient?

4. **Domain Name**: Should domain be purchased before or after MVP completion?

5. **Future Backend Services**: When adding dedicated services (Python/Go/Rust), should we create a separate GitHub repo or monorepo?

---

## 12. Success Metrics (Post-MVP)

While not tracked in MVP, future success can be measured by:

- **Technical Showcase**: Positive feedback from recruiters/developers
- **Personal Utility**: Active use of private tools (e.g., investment portfolio)
- **Extensibility**: Time to add new project (target: < 1 day per simple project)
- **Performance**: Consistent lighthouse scores 90+
- **Reliability**: Zero downtime incidents
