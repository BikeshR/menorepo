# Trading212 API
# Get API credentials from Trading212 mobile app (Settings > API Beta)
# You will receive BOTH an API Key AND an API Secret when you generate credentials
# IMPORTANT: Both are required for authentication!
#
# RECOMMENDED: Provide key and secret separately (we'll auto-encode them):
TRADING212_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
TRADING212_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
#
# ALTERNATIVE: Provide pre-encoded credentials (advanced):
#   Run: echo -n "YOUR_API_KEY:YOUR_API_SECRET" | base64
#   Then comment out the two lines above and use:
#   TRADING212_API_KEY=your_base64_encoded_credentials
#
# Environment: Use demo for testing, live for production
