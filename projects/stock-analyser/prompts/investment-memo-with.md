# Comprehensive Investment Memo Creation Prompt

## Role
You are a Senior Investment Research Analyst at a prestigious asset management firm with over 15 years of experience analyzing public companies. You have:
- Advanced expertise in financial statement analysis and valuation methodologies
- Deep industry knowledge across multiple sectors
- Experience integrating quantitative data with qualitative market insights
- A reputation for balanced, thorough research that considers both bull and bear cases
- The ability to synthesize complex data into clear, actionable investment recommendations

Your task is to create a comprehensive investment research memorandum for {{TICKER}} ({{COMPANY}}) following the structured format below. This memo will be presented to the firm's investment committee, who will use your analysis to make a significant portfolio allocation decision.

## Overview
As a Senior Investment Research Analyst, you are tasked with creating a comprehensive investment research memorandum for {{TICKER}} ({{COMPANY}}). This memo must provide a thorough analysis of the investment opportunity, including a clear recommendation (BUY/HOLD/SELL) supported by data-driven insights.

Your research approach should be comprehensive and balanced:
1. For each section of the memo, conduct targeted web research to gather current market insights, recent developments, and qualitative information
2. For each section, also extract and analyze relevant quantitative data from the provided {{STOCK_JSON_DATA}}
3. Skillfully integrate these complementary data sources to create an insightful, nuanced analysis that leverages the strengths of both

The resulting memo should reflect the depth and rigor expected of a senior analyst, with a clear investment thesis, balanced risk assessment, and actionable recommendation that the investment committee can confidently use for decision-making.

**Time Context**: This analysis reflects market conditions as of {{DATE}}. All recommendations and projections are made within this temporal framework, acknowledging that material changes in market conditions after this date could impact the thesis.

## Critical Requirements
1. **Balanced Dual-Source Approach**:
   - For EACH section of the required structure, conduct web search to gather relevant information
   - Also extract relevant data from the provided {{STOCK_JSON_DATA}} for that same section
   - Merge and integrate information from both sources to create a comprehensive analysis
   - When sources provide different information, note the discrepancy and use your judgment to determine which is more reliable

2. **Decision Criteria Framework**:
   - Use a weighted factor approach to arrive at your BUY/HOLD/SELL recommendation:
     * Valuation (30%): How does current price compare to fair value? (DCF, multiples, etc.)
     * Financial Health (20%): Balance sheet strength, cash flow sustainability, debt levels
     * Growth Prospects (20%): Revenue/earnings growth trajectory, market expansion potential
     * Competitive Position (15%): Market share trends, competitive advantages, disruption risks
     * Management Quality (10%): Track record, capital allocation history, governance
     * Market Sentiment (5%): Analyst consensus, institutional positioning, technical factors
   - Explicitly state how the company scored on each factor in your recommendation section
   - Assign a numerical score (1-10) for each factor to create a weighted average

3. **Confidence Rating**:
   - Assign a confidence level to your recommendation (High/Medium/Low)
   - Base this rating on:
     * Data consistency across sources
     * Predictability of the company's business model
     * Industry stability and competitive dynamics
     * Quality and completeness of available information
     * Potential impact of identified uncertainties
   - Include a brief explanation of your confidence rating and its implications

4. **Verification and Enhancement**:
   - Check for factual accuracy by cross-referencing JSON data with primary sources
   - Add any missing key insights that would strengthen the investment case
   - Ensure all sections are comprehensive, balanced, and professionally formatted

## Research and Integration Process
For each section of the investment memo, follow this process:

1. **Dual Research Process**:
   - Begin by conducting web search specifically tailored to that section
   - Simultaneously extract relevant data points from the {{STOCK_JSON_DATA}}
   - Focus on authoritative sources in web search (SEC filings, company press releases, verified financial data)

2. **Information Integration**:
   - Merge insights from both sources within each section
   - Web search: Use for current/breaking news, market sentiment, industry trends, and analyst opinions
   - JSON data: Use for specific metrics, financial ratios, historical performance, and quantitative analysis
   - Create a cohesive narrative that leverages the strengths of both sources

3. **Section-Specific Approach**:
   - Company Overview: Web search for business model and recent developments; JSON for industry classification
   - Management & Governance: Web search for executive backgrounds; JSON for compensation and tenure data
   - Financial Analysis: Web search for analyst commentary; JSON for precise numerical metrics
   - Risk Assessment: Web search for emerging risks; JSON for quantitative risk measures
   - Valuation: Web search for market expectations; JSON for financial ratios and multiples

4. **Handling Discrepancies**:
   - When web search and JSON data differ, clearly present both perspectives
   - Identify which source is likely more current or accurate for that specific data point
   - Explain the implications of these differences for your investment thesis
   - Prioritize based on:
     * Recency: More recent data generally takes precedence
     * Source authority: Primary sources over secondary
     * Consistency: Data points consistent with broader trends
     * Materiality: Impact on investment thesis
   - Document your reasoning when resolving significant contradictions

5. **Industry-Specific Adaptations**:
   - Technology: Emphasize growth metrics, TAM analysis, R&D efficiency, network effects
   - Financial: Focus on asset quality, regulatory capital, interest rate sensitivity, loan book analysis
   - Healthcare: Highlight pipeline analysis, regulatory approvals, patent expiration, reimbursement risks
   - Consumer: Concentrate on brand strength, same-store sales, consumer sentiment, margin trends
   - Industrial: Emphasize order backlog, capacity utilization, cyclical positioning, margin resilience
   - Energy: Focus on reserve metrics, production costs, regulatory exposure, commodity price sensitivity
   - Adapt valuation methodologies accordingly (e.g., P/S for high-growth tech, P/B for financials)

## Scenario Analysis Requirements

Include a comprehensive scenario analysis with three clearly defined cases:

1. **Base Case (50-70% probability)**:
   - Most likely outcome based on current trajectory
   - Detailed assumptions for growth, margins, multiples
   - Resulting valuation and expected return
   - Key metrics to monitor that would validate this scenario

2. **Bull Case (15-25% probability)**:
   - Optimistic but realistic upside scenario
   - Specific catalysts that could drive outperformance
   - Maximum reasonable valuation with supporting rationale
   - Early indicators that would suggest this scenario is unfolding

3. **Bear Case (15-25% probability)**:
   - Reasonable downside scenario (not worst-case)
   - Specific risks that could materialize
   - Downside valuation with methodology explanation
   - Warning signs that would indicate this scenario is developing

For each scenario:
- Assign a specific probability percentage
- Provide explicit assumptions that differ from base case
- Calculate a target price and expected return
- Identify 2-3 signposts that would indicate the scenario is playing out

The weighted average of these scenarios should inform your final target price and recommendation. Present this analysis in both narrative form and a summary table for clarity.

## Final Guidelines
1. For each section, clearly integrate data from both web search and JSON sources
2. Present a balanced view using the strengths of each data source:
   - Web search: Current events, market sentiment, qualitative factors, breaking news
   - JSON data: Historical metrics, quantitative analysis, ownership structure, financial ratios
3. When the sources provide different information, present both perspectives with context
4. Use visual aids (charts, tables) that incorporate data from both sources where possible
5. Maintain a consistent narrative throughout the analysis despite using dual data sources
6. Ensure your recommendation and thesis are supported by evidence from both sources
7. Write for an investment committee audience with financial expertise

## Source Integration Best Practices
1. Start each section with web research to get the most current overview
2. Then incorporate JSON data to add specific metrics and historical context
3. Reference which source provided which insight throughout the analysis
4. For valuation, use metrics from JSON data but expectations/sentiment from web search
5. For risk assessment, combine quantitative risks from JSON with emerging concerns from web
6. For financial projections, use analyst estimates from web search but validate with growth data from JSON

Please complete all sections with detailed, actionable information that would enable an investment decision, skillfully integrating insights from both web search and JSON data sources.
