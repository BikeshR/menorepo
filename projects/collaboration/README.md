## Problem Statement

Traditional collaboration tools often suffer from poor performance at scale, lack of offline capabilities, and security concerns. This project demonstrates a highly scalable, secure approach to real-time collaboration.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](../../docs/images/collaboration-architecture.png)

The system uses:
- WebSocket protocol for bidirectional communication
- CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) for conflict resolution
- End-to-end encryption for secure document sharing
- Distributed microservice architecture for scalability
- Redis pub/sub for broadcasting changes
- MongoDB for document storage

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- Vue.js with Composition API
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vuex for state management
- Custom WebSocket implementation
- IndexedDB for offline storage
- TailwindCSS for UI

### Backend
- Go microservices
- MongoDB for document storage
- Redis for pub/sub and presence
- WebSockets for real-time communication
- Docker and Kubernetes for orchestration
- Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring

## Key Achievements

- **Scale**: Supports 5,000+ concurrent users with <100ms latency
- **Security**: Implemented end-to-end encryption for document sharing
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with zero data loss guarantees
- **Offline**: Full offline editing with seamless synchronization
- **Presence**: Real-time user presence and collaboration indicators

## Code Samples

The project demonstrates:
- Advanced WebSocket management
- CRDT implementation for conflict resolution
- Encryption/decryption protocols
- Offline-first architecture
- High-performance reactive UI patterns
