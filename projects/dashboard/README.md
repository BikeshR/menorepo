## Problem Statement

Enterprise reporting systems often struggle with large datasets, complicated access controls, and maintaining performance at scale. This project demonstrates a modern approach to handling these challenges.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](../../docs/images/dashboard-architecture.png)

The system uses:
- Angular frontend with modular design
- FastAPI backend with asynchronous request handling
- TimescaleDB for time-series data storage
- Redis for caching frequent queries
- Role-based access control system
- ETL pipeline for data ingestion
- Data aggregation microservices

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- Angular with TypeScript
- NgRx for state management
- D3.js and Chart.js for visualizations
- Angular Material for UI components
- RxJS for reactive programming
- Jasmine and Karma for testing

### Backend
- Python with FastAPI
- PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension
- Redis for caching
- Pandas for data processing
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration

## Key Achievements

- **Performance**: Processed and visualized 10M+ data points with sub-second rendering
- **Efficiency**: Reduced reporting generation time by 80%
- **Security**: Implemented role-based access control for sensitive data
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling for handling enterprise-level data volumes
- **Integration**: Seamless connectivity with various data sources

## Code Samples

The project demonstrates:
- Advanced data visualization techniques
- Time-series data processing and optimization
- Complex role-based permissions system
- High-performance API design
- Responsive UI for various screen sizes
