# AI Patent Platform UI

A revolutionary user interface for Solve Intelligence's AI-powered patent platform, designed to transform how IP professionals interact with AI technology.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create the industry's most intuitive and efficient UI for:
- Invention harvesting and disclosure management
- AI-assisted patent application drafting  
- IP portfolio management and analytics
- Prior art search and analysis

## Development Workflow

This project follows a structured development approach:

### 1. ‚úÖ Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Status:** Complete  
**Location:** `planning/PRD.md`  
**Description:** Comprehensive requirements analysis including user personas, functional requirements, technical specifications, and success metrics.

### 2. ‚úÖ Architecture Decision Record (ADR) 
**Status:** Complete  
**Location:** `planning/ADR.md`  
**Description:** Technical architecture decisions, technology stack rationale, and system design patterns.

### 3. ‚úÖ Implementation Plan
**Status:** Complete  
**Location:** `planning/implementation-plan.md`  
**Description:** Detailed development roadmap, sprint planning, and milestone definitions.

### 4. ‚è≥ Implementation
**Status:** Ready to Begin  
**Location:** `src/`  
**Description:** Actual code implementation following the defined architecture and plan.

**Completed Phases:**
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: UX Research & User Journey Mapping
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2**: Wireframing & UI Design Specifications  
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3**: Design System & Component Library
- üîÑ **Phase 4**: Core Architecture & Foundation (Next)

**Documentation:**
- `docs/ux-research.md` - Comprehensive user research and journey analysis
- `docs/wireframes-and-ui-specs.md` - Detailed wireframe descriptions and component specifications

**Implementation:**
- `src/` - Next.js 15 + React 19 application with complete component library
- **Components Built**: 15+ production-ready components with TypeScript
- **Design System**: Tailwind CSS 4 with custom AI/patent tokens
- **Live Demo**: http://localhost:3000 (when running `npm run dev`)

## Key Innovation Areas

Based on market research, this project will pioneer:

1. **Conversational Patent Drafting** - Natural language interfaces for patent creation
2. **AI Transparency Framework** - Clear confidence levels and reasoning for all AI suggestions
3. **Progressive Complexity UI** - Interfaces that adapt to user expertise levels
4. **Collaborative Intelligence** - AI-mediated team collaboration features
5. **Predictive Portfolio Management** - AI-powered strategic filing recommendations

## Target Users

- **Patent Attorneys** - Primary users managing 50-200 active cases
- **IP Paralegals** - Supporting complex document workflows
- **In-House IP Counsel** - Strategic portfolio management

## Competitive Advantage

This UI will differentiate Solve Intelligence by:
- Creating the first truly intuitive AI patent platform interface
- Reducing the learning curve for AI-resistant legal professionals
- Amplifying the existing 50-90% efficiency gains through superior UX
- Establishing first-mover advantage in AI patent UI/UX

## Next Steps

1. **Review PRD** - Validate requirements and user personas
2. **Create ADR** - Define technical architecture and implementation approach
3. **Develop Implementation Plan** - Create detailed sprint roadmap
4. **Begin Implementation** - Start with core React architecture and design system

## Getting Started

To begin development:

1. Review the PRD to understand requirements
2. Wait for ADR completion to understand technical approach
3. Follow implementation plan for development phases
4. Use the boilerplate React setup from `/boilerplates/react/` as foundation

## Research & Context

This project is based on extensive research of:
- Solve Intelligence's product and market position
- Competitive landscape analysis (Patlytics, Edge, PQAI, IPRally)
- Patent attorney workflow challenges and pain points
- Legal tech UI/UX best practices and design patterns

The full research and requirements are documented in the PRD.
